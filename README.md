🌧️ Rainfall Prediction
This project explores the challenge of predicting rainfall using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes various meteorological features like temperature, humidity, wind conditions, and other atmospheric variables that can influence rainfall events.

📊 About the Dataset
The dataset consists of historical weather observations, with each row representing a day's measurements and a target label indicating whether it rained or not. It includes both numerical and categorical features relevant to atmospheric conditions. This data allows us to train models that can learn patterns and make reliable predictions about future rainfall.

🔍 What I Did
I applied and compared multiple classification algorithms to solve the prediction task:

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Among all the models, Random Forest performed the best, achieving an accuracy of 86%, making it the most robust choice for this problem.
